# Air-Quality-Index
We are implementing our project  by using  Machine learning algorithm.The dataset used will be standard existing datasets like Air quality data in india(2015-2020).The proposed method is linear regression Algorithm for detecting the air pollutants in the air.
List the Expected Deliverables of this project:
 The level of air pollution.
 Suggestions to the general public so that air pollution can be managed to some extent.
 Detecting Harmful Pollutants in the air.
The suggestions lead to the increase in the use of public transport and planting more plants which decreases the CO2 content in the atmosphere.
  Novelty- Our project helps the general people by giving them inputs on how not to pollute the air and preserve the heritage for future.
      Uniqueness- Existing methods donâ€™t use machine learning methods hence accuracy is not upto the mark..
